# SONG: Synergetic Learning System based on Swarm of Non-Gradient Learners
We present a synergetic learning system based on swarm of non-gradient learners (SONG). The proposed learning system is constructed based on the synergies of flocks of lightweight, efficient, scalable base components. Inspired by the process of 'evolution and selection', our approach constructs systems in a data-driven manner, commencing from simplicity and progressively advancing towards complexity, simplifying both architecture design and hyperparameter tuning.

## Getting started
### Install
Clone our repository and navigate to SONG folder
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/B-berrypie/SONG.git
   cd SONG
   ```

The Python version of the code will be uploaded shortly.
